Direct print to Zebra printers from SAP

This is the first version of the zebra print program. You can only print text, a horizontal line and a 3of9 barcode at the moment. But there are a lot of features coming next.

The SAP spooler will be used for the label output. For the outqueue use a generic device driver like LB_ZEB2.

A simple tool for designing the labels is also in planning.
